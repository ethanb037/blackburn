We are a collaboration that does not end at simply two of us. As art workers, we are impelled to inhabit a space that is made up of many different art workers, dignified in their own mimetic responsibilities, and in pursuit of that which is unspeakably bigger than all of us.

Jan van Eyck applies then the most important capabilities for our continuing research— a facility of budding art workers, facilities such as the printing lab to support our visual documentation through periodical zines and instructions (such as scores), and the most important facility of a place to enact our processional practices.

                We want to tell people that there is more than one way of knowing. Ars Culus Is a collectism-driven enterprise that covers themes of relativistic politics in the consumed. To simplify, we assemble to disseminate paradoxical paradigms that catalyze statistical convergence towards symbiotic synergy. For You, The One Who’s Already Half-Made of Everything:




Penance is a sacrifice. 
It allows the mind to surrender after flailing around to be all that it believes it is. The measurements of a ritual is in a similar quantity. 
- The ancients believed in chants. 
- These chants had fire sometimes.
- The fire had power sometimes.

We submit to the gods of assurity, of confirmations to establish a connect with a higher entity, all while beguiled to smithereens about the entirety. 
The term ritual, though appearing as a binary that would suggest the (NOT)ritual, is bereft of significance by the utter lack of requirements to survive therein.
A pilgrimage is the accruing of interest in the divine, the mother of tourism even— undoubtedly of artistry.
- A statue of a distant lands serves regular salutations to oblivion. 


The sole ritual is that of creating music for music, as a surrender to the desire to impose/impress/introduce what belief(s) is(are) ours. 
-A ritual is a knitted ladder that carries the desire of a certain direction, unaware of time, existing beyond good nor evil.
Ars Culus makes a detour to the surrender into continuous medium immersion as pilgrimage. 
The act of sharing is the meagre, blessed sweet morsels distributed. The commitment to serve is paramount in this concert. We don't accept the binary presentation as a duality, though obvious it may seem. 
The presentation, across all mediums, will be presented as a singularity. One thing is only but a temporal distortion of another. The ritual, the penance, the pilgrimage is the only service Ars Culus can provide to the current situation. A ritual serves a quasi purpose to most, and we mean to objectively parade the act of generating music, to exist, to create nothing and everything… but never to deter any prominence away from the very ritual of living; the very ritual of breathing; the very ritual of pretending; the very ritualistic act of conviction itself. 


______________________________________

“ars culus embarks on a ritual composed of many smaller rituals (in a quest) to enter(tain) others.”

To begin, picture a space of performance, now on referred to as the stage. 
It is thus; the separation of two music workers, isolated from another on said stage with a solid divider in between, each with a piano and a table for refreshments and electronics, and a bed for reclination and rest. Importantly, each Ritualgeber is engaged with the saprogenic task of being completely isolated from another; musically, socially, existentially. 

The nature of the presentation is the composite of two individual performances that evolve in time, over a course of Three days, nonstop. The 72 hours will be submitted at the altar of Music. Ars Culus will be at the craft of creating.. duration-bound, creating to share, living in the space kindly provided by you truly. 
Continuously, for these 72 hours, three days, we will live at the performance space, stream, eat on the table with our laptops, sleep on a foldable bed, generate visuals, and importantly deliver a performance so free of typical onanistic performance pretense due to the fact that we stand in between the front-region and back region of the audience; that we exist honestly and causally. Our cause is to expose boundaries;
- the boundary physical between us, 
- the boundary between ritual and everyday practice,
- the boundary between performer and listener, 
- the boundary between solidarity and inaction,
- the boundary between you and me,
to bring back every atavistic idea of performance and simultaneously disable them… that rituals do not necessarily begin with intent but qua circumstance.  
Visuals accompany us from behind, produced live. A camera streams our minute actions, rituals, and displays them with credulity for physical and parasocial audiences. Our basic needs will be fulfilled by small intervallic breaks and assistants to provide us sustenance. The rest lies in you.


What makes our project unique and important in today's world?
The world operates in a performance we refuse to acknowledge. When we attempt to traverse this through perceived/intended artistic expression, we admit we give to the world only copies, imitations of reality. How do we transgress this voile we permit ourselves to, without compromising the integrity of the mundane? We, ars culus, declare our existence not exclusive to stages, thereby transmuting the same ritualistic significance of the stage as to our morning ritual of bathing and consuming coffee through penance. Other art collectives underpinned by a secondary trajectory attempt to subjugate messages but fall short at admitting the unnatural temporality of their performance, whether by choosing to end with applause or playing for 4 minutes on an iceberg for Greenpeace. Why are we important? We acknowledge that our hopefully despondent exhibition of our creed and the banal search for it, is our only possible method of existence. All that is left is to display the call for our penance. 





When we are given a space to perform, we extend that space to others. Ars Culus presents a 72-hour durational performance that challenges conventional notions of performance and art. We are naturally immersed and imputed by exclusive spaces, exclusionary clauses, into the spread of misinformation. People are aware of the ingenuousness of any persons hiding behind their performance. Through a continuous (of at least 24 -  36 hours) performance, we elevate the mundanity of engaging with others in a public space into spectacle, questioning the role of intent and authenticity in art, and questioning how information is interpreted through interaction and its broadcast (through a continuous YouTube stream of the performance). This experimental work invites audiences to reconsider the boundaries of performance and indulge in the power of community in the artistic process.
