            3. Fax your signature
            4. Breathe into the monitor


		    now.

diktat of the art worker.
	the art worker… 
1. shall create.
2. shall enable creation.
3. shall resist discrimination.
4. shall resist idolization. 
5. shall submit.
6. shall sublimate.
7. shall sublate.
8. shall collaborate.
9. shall assimilate.
10. works for no one.
11. is of every one.
12. shall love.

Ars culus sends its two favourite art workers out in Maastricht to spread joyous news of a universal freedom to create. 

worker Ethan Blackburn is an American sound artist centered on visual communications between art and artist. With his experience as a musician, he aims to engage with sound and space through social contexts as noise.  

worker V Noel, hailing from India, proposes therapeutic effects of community art experiences. He facilitates active audience performances that ask for help in completing the experience. 

They are here to claim a joyous news of a universal right to create.



		    
		How things endure? 
		How things begin? 
		How absence speaks? 
		How habits know themself?
		 How does the radio know when you're finally learning the lyrics? 
		How does an unnoticed maintain its membership?
		 How does a key know its teeth? 
		How does the shelf know its edge? 
		How does the hook carry itself? 
		how can coming come? how sitting sits? 
		how does melting melts melted? 
		How might a wall count its cracks? 
		How does a door know the impatient? 
		How when a word book refuses to contain containing which it promised to contain? 
		How will do I close covers? How do I read upside down? 
		How might a clock, a streetlight?
		 How do I say something without repeating anyone else? 
		How will repetition hold me? 
		How will others know me? 
		How is it possible that certain objects or places appear, over extended observation, to cultivate a richness, significance and an almost animate presence as the possibility for meaningful human interaction, to those same observers, slowly and increasingly disappear and turns instead towards zero?
		How if meaning decides to take an unauthorized vacation from its meaning-duties?
		How do inanimate people remain living? 
		How do I read lips? 
		How to make without thinking? 
		How weight grounds? 
		How to know noise? 
		How to distinguish approach of realization? 
		How do I know absence? 
		How when numbers number a little too much and start to letter? 
		How are moments linked together? 
		How to grow without knowing? 
		How a child and his dog? 
		How will feeling be felt?
		 How will things change once they’re understood as over? 
		How when color refuses to maintain its chromatic responsibilities? 
		When volume asserts loud to wide and wide to loud confusing its cubic sense of self with a probable disconnected sense of spatial significance, but that they may never meet and be known as occupations of two different sized spaces to another?
		 How if Sunday doesn’t show proper affection to Monday? 
		How when four birds are precisely not four but also not quite three?
		 How when they never were over? 
		How when this necessitates the absence of birthed and repressed sentiment to be privatized in your own language before you recall its significance at the end of this sentence? 
		How if an alphabet reputes itself without consulting proper alphabetical authority? 
		How light remembers? How does structure structure structurally structuring structured structures? 
		How endings begin? 
		How to fragment a unity?
		 How when collecting embarks on training to assert itself as a lifestyle, but targets the wrong verbal audience? 
		How to hear silent now? 
		How a line can curve?
		 How a wind can move?
		 How redness is how it is? 
		How to make is doing to be but how to approach?
		How it will be, when it is how to see, when is how now gone here when so much nothing to become? 
		How to touch without touching? 
		How to face and facing? 

		    
why are we motivated?:
We want to tell people that there is more than one way of knowing.
Ars Culus Is a collectism-driven enterprise that covers themes of relativistic politics in the consumed. 
To simplify, we assemble to disseminate paradoxical paradigms that catalyze statistical convergence towards symbiotic synergy.
As in, we want to question why is something art or not.
